Welcome to Xceed Extended WPF Toolkit Plus

Welcome to the documentation for Xceed Extended WPF Toolkit Plus!

The Extended WPF Toolkit CodePlex project—which provides controls and functionalities that both WPF and the original Microsoft WPF Toolkit lack—has improved the programming experience of hundreds of thousands of WPF developers and allowed them to produce software that is otherwise much more difficult and time-consuming to create. Xceed—a key player in the software component industry—offers the wildly popular project, and a seasoned team of programmers and designers is actively developing both the Community Edition and the Plus Edition. We would like it to be something the WPF community can count on, given that the original Microsoft WPF Toolkit hasn't changed in a few years!

Xceed Extended WPF Toolkit Plus includes over 60 essential controls that are not included in WPF and the WPF Toolkit, such as BusyIndicator, Calculator, various "UpDown" numerical controls, ChildWindow (which takes an entirely different approach than the one in the Silverlight Toolkit), chart, ColorPicker, DateTimePicker, docking window control, MaskedTextBox, themable MessageBox, Pie, PropertyGrid, RichTextBox with enhanced databinding and formatting capabilities, SwitchPanel and its associated layout panels (e.g., DockPanel), Tokenized TextBox, WatermarkTextBox, and ZoomBox. It also includes a special Toolkit version of Xceed’s industry-leading WPF datagrid, which delivers a fluid, high-performance user experience. It provides over a dozen 2D WPF layouts, which work with the product’s core layout-to-layout animation control, SwitchPanel. It also includes themes for all the controls.

There are ways to license Xceed Extended WPF Toolkit Plus. The first is to purchase a license for the current version only. The license is per developer, allows you to use the Plus Edition in any number of projects, and it is perpetual. The second is to purchase the Plus Edition with a subscription that adds updates and upgrades to new versions for one year (all versions received include a perpetual license for that version), and you also get a year of expert priority support.

All Xceed products can be tried out with a fully functional 45-day trial.

For 20 years now, Xceed has been creating top-of-the-line WPF, .NET, Silverlight, and COM software components. Our current product line has over 100 professional components, which are used by more than 100,000 professional developers worldwide, including by Microsoft in many applications such as Visual Studio, Microsoft Office, and some Windows Server editions.
